<h2>Description</h2>

In this paper, we provide a thorough overview of water polo, including its basics, popularity, and projected growth. We conduct a literature review on existing water polo analytics, exploring metrics used for evaluating team performance and individual performance. We identify the top-performing teams based on these metrics and propose new analytical measures not currently utilized in water polo. These innovative metrics aim to enhance the understanding and assessment of current gameplay, potentially shaping the future of the sport by offering fresh perspectives on performance analysis.
